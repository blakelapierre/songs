Mia Rodriguez,
I barely knew you
you barely knew me
but we came together
I believe that it's true
until you tell me otherwise
which would be cool too

MR is for short,
much shorter than three
come ride with me
how long it can be
you know that I'm right
you've already seen
could do so much
like we've already been

Jenn Tyler on kik
why I don't know
JT I don't call you
but maybe will start

can make something common
part of my art
words are just words
but you do have my heart

share with me all
then we will see
a beautiful world
for all it could be

maybe I'm wrong
maybe it can't

give it a chance
I got you to dance

could rhyme to the end
but it's getting hard
to tell you in words
just where that we are

Mia Rodriguez, MR, and all that
tell me again
how soon we can chat
